        <h2>About this project.</h2>
        <p>I am an admirer of <a href="https://newcss.net/">new.css</a>. HTML is a semantic language, which in turn
            means that you shouldn't have to be overriding too much in your small projects. There are some small things
            I wanted to do differently, and there you go: careless.css. Feel free to use it, make copies. Would be nice
            if you credit me somewhere or just buy me a coffee.</p>
        <h3>So what's differently?</h3>
        <p>new css resets margin and padding to 0 and then applies their own set of css rules. Careless css works with
            the browser styling. I only start resetting when I see it becomes aesthetically displeasing.</p>
        <h3>About the name.</h3>
        <p>Naming things is about the hardest thing in computer science. Thinking of impressive classnames for websites
            is up there. As front-end developers we've
            come up with a lot of strategies; Atomic CSS, BEM, SMACC and whatnot. The best naming is
            <code>header</code>, <code>main</code>, <code>footer</code>, <code>section</code>, and so on.
