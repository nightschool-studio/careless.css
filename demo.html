        <h1>H1 - Heading 1</h1>
        <p>A paragraph of text. Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They don't toil, neither do they spin.
        </p>
        <h2>H2 - Heading 2</h2>
        <p>A paragraph of text. Green in nature is one thing, green in literature another. Nature and letters seem to
            have a natural antipathy; bring them together and they tear each other to pieces. -- Virginia Woolf,
            Orlando.</p>
        <h3>H3 - Heading 3</h3>
        <p>A paragraph of text. Whenever you are faced with the prospect of purchasing gloves, you must ask yourself if
            you would be bereft to lose one
            of them in the back of a taxicab. If not, then don’t buy them. You should only buy gloves so beautiful that
            to lose one of them would break your heart. -- Elizabeth Gilbert, City of Girls.</p>
        <h4>H4 - Heading 4</h4>
        <p>A paragraph of text. Thanks to our love of avoidance, the average person spends more time figuring out which
            is the perfect angle to take
            the hottest selfie from than she does figuring out what she really wants out of life. -- Jen Sincero. </p>
        <h5>H5 - Heading 5</h5>
        <p>A paragraph of text. Someone is as big as the size of their heart, not the size of their height, weight or
            current bank statement.
        </p>
        <h6>H6 - Heading 6</h6>
        <p>A paragraph of text. The best things in life are free. The second best things in life are very expensive. --
            Coco Chanel </p>

            “We gave the <i>Prix de Rome</i> the other day to a young man who <mark>wasn't expecting to win</mark> it
            and who went
            almost
            mad with joy.
            We were all expecting the prize to go to <strong>Camille Saint-Saëns</strong>, who had the strange notion of
            competing. I
            confess I was
            sorry to vote <s>against a man</s> who is truly a great artist and one who is
            already well known, practically a
            celebrity. But
            the other man, who is <u>still a student</u>, has that inner fire, inspiration, he feels, he can do things
            that
            can't be learnt
            and the rest he'll learn more or less. So I voted for him, sighing at
            <code>the thought of the unhappiness</code> that
            this failure
            must cause Saint-Saëns. But, whatever else, one must be honest”

        <blockquote>More quotes. The dismal fact is that self-respect has nothing to do with the approval of others—who
            are, after all, deceived easily
            enough; has nothing to do with reputation—which, as Rhett Butler told Scarlett O'Hara, is something that
            people with courage can do without.</blockquote>
