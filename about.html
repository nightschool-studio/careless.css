        <h2>About this project.</h2>
        <p>Each browser assigns a default set of behavior to an HTML element with a different result. To have a uniform
            look in each browser, it is a custom practice to add a reset.css and a normalize.css.</p>
        <p>Over time I noticed developers overriding many styles, not just bootstrap, including reset.css or
            normalize.css. At a
            certain point, this resulted in an almost unworkable process to make updates.</p>

        <p>In many of my projects, I ended up ripping out the CSS file and rebuilding the structure from scratch. I was
            exposed to
            the documentation of HTML elements, and I became fascinated.</p>
        <p>When researching the Mozilla documentation of elements, I noticed many HTML elements already have desirable
            styling. Add
            to this as developers, we're regularly trying to optimize our codeâ€” a fortunate outcome for SEO.</p>
        <p>Feel free to use it, make copies. Would be nice
            if you credit me somewhere or just buy me a coffee. But if you won't - I won't get angry.</p>
        <h3>About the name.</h3>
        <p>Naming things is about the hardest thing in computer science. Thinking of impressive classnames for websites
            is up there. As front-end developers we've
            come up with a lot of strategies; Atomic CSS, BEM, SMACC and whatnot. The best naming is simply
            <code>header</code>, <code>main</code>, <code>footer</code>, <code>section</code>, and so on.
